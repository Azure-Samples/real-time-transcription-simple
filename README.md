# Real Time Transcription - Simple

This repository demonstrates how to quickly and easily build a Real Time Transcription running on a web browser.

The app that you will deploy will look like this:

<img src="./pics/resp-002.gif" width=800 />

You will be able to create your first app in less than 1/2 hour.

You can then modify the application to meet your requirements.

This post is the number 1 post of a series of posts, demonstrating Azure Speech to Text in real-time, that will be increasingly more complex.

## The Technology Used

You will be using: 

* **Azure Speech-to-Text**
* **React.js** with Javascript (with Bootstrap, to make things look good)
* **Devcontainers** - You can use this repo on your PC/MAC or on Codespaces in Github. This makes it easy for you to develop without having to install Node, NPM, or the React modules you will need

By following the steps under [Installation](installation) you wil be able to get started quickly

## The Features

You will get an app like the one shown below:



The architecture is shown below:


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This repository is used to build the application on a personal computer or on GitHub Codespaces. It uses a devcontaier.

You need to have the following on your personal computer (PC, Mac or Linux):

* Visual Studio Code - you can install it from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
* Docker Desktop - you can install it from here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
* Git - you can install it from here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

### Installation

#### Azure Services

The first step is to enable the required **Azure Cognitive Services**. To do that: 

* Click the button bellow:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Freal-time-transcription-simple%2Fmain%2F.arm%2FCognitiveServices%2Ftemplate.json%3Ftoken%3DGHSAT0AAAAAAB47JS5E5ZU636XJRJR6KB2IY7JZORA)

Once you have the prerequisites met:

* Clone the repository
* Open it with Visual Studio Code. 

You will get a screen like this:

<img src="./pics/resp-001.png" />

* Click **Reopen in Container** to open the Devcontainer. Node, yarn, etc. are installed on it, and that is all you need to build and run your webapp.
