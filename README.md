# Real Time Transcription - Simple

This repository demonstrates how to quickly and easily build a Real Time Transcription running on a web browser. In fact, the target is for you to build your first application in less than 1/2 hour.

## The Tech

* Azure Speech-to-Text
* React.js (we added bootstrap to make things look good)
* Devcontainers - inside Visual Studio Code, we created a container with all the pre-requisite, so that you can hit the ground running.
